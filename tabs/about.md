# Hi!

## About me: 

<!-- I'm interested in Data Science, and particularly in fun, novel applications of machine learning!

I’m currently looking to get my first job in DS, having come to the end of my PhD in particle-physics. 

During this PhD, I worked on data analysis with the full ATLAS Run II data set recorded at @CERN in Geneva. This data set consists of around 1 × 10¹⁶ proton-proton collisions, so some seriously "Big Data"!!

I searched this data set for the pair production of "Leptoquarks", which are a hypothetical new class of fundamental particle, which can decay directly into both leptons and quarks. If you're interested in this then you can check it out in my publications list, and if you want to learn more, feel free shoot me a message! -->

I'm a data scientist with a deep-rooted passion for machine learning, Bayesian statistics, and the exciting world of large language models. My academic background in physics laid the foundation for a career where curiosity and a love for complex problem-solving are at the forefront.

<!-- My journey in data science is driven by a fascination with Bayesian inference and its profound impact on statistical analysis. This approach resonates deeply with my analytical mindset, allowing me to uncover insights from data in a way that's both rigorous and intuitive. -->

<!-- Machine learning, and some of the recent developments in generative modelling is another focus of mine. The capabilities of these models to understand, interpret, and generate human language is nothing short of revolutionary. I'm constantly exploring new advancements in this field, staying ahead of the curve in a rapidly evolving landscape. -->

A strongly Bayesian mindset has transformed my thinking, and my approach to complex problem solving. I have taken the lessons that i've learnt from studying this statistical framework and applied them across several projects that you can read about in this website, including a recent publication on the use of Bayesian inference in time series forecasting for highly stochastic, non-stationary, and non-gaussian processes. 

Having worked extensively cross-domaine in data science, I have developed a diverse skill set, from producing production quality code, deployed on cloud compute infrastructure, to implementing various high-impact POC projects, to advocate for the power of data science innovation across various industries.

Through various projects, I have developed a strong grasp of image processing algorithms, pattern recognition, and the application of deep learning techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). My work in this area not only underscores my technical proficiency but also my ability to apply these skills to real-world problems, creating tangible improvements and demonstrating what can be possible with a data-centric approach.

Machine learning, and recent developments in generative modelling is another focus of mine. The capabilities of these models and their wide spread adoption has already begun to transform industries, and the potential in this space is only just beginning to be utilized. I'm constantly exploring new advancements in this field, staying ahead of the curve in a rapidly evolving landscape.
