# Hi!

## About me: 

I'm interested in Data Science, and particularly in fun, novel applications of machine learning!

I’m currently looking to get my first job in DS, having come to the end of my PhD in particle-physics. 

During this PhD, I worked on data analysis with the full ATLAS Run II data set recorded at @CERN in Geneva. This data set consists of around 1 × 10¹⁶ proton-proton collisions, so some seriously "Big Data"!!

I searched this data set for the pair production of "Leptoquarks", which are a hypothetical new class of fundamental particle, which can decay directly into both leptons and quarks. If you're interested in this then you can check it out in my publications list, and if you want to learn more, feel free shoot me a message!

## 📫 How to reach me 

If you want to find out more about my work, please shoot me a message over on my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-jaspan/) or you can email me by filling in the contact form below.
