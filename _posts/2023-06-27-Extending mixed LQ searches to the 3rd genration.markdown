# [Search for pair-produced scalar and vector leptoquarks decaying into third-generation quarks and first- or second-generation leptons](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP06(2023)188)

This paper follows on from my [previous post](2020-11-19-LQMix.markdown) on Leptoquark searches with the ATLAS detector. For an introduction to the topic, feel free to refer back to that post.

Leptoquarks are intriguing because they could explain observed discrepancies in the behavior of leptons (like muons) that current models cannot. The study is particularly focused on LQs that might interact with quarks and leptons from different generations, extending the phase space of this search to the $3^{rd}$ generation of quarks. This area has recently garnered interest due to its potential to explain certain highly impactful experimental observations​​.

This research utilized data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) Run 2, which included proton-proton collisions between 2015 and 2018. The analysis strategy centered around a final-state signature consisting of one lepton, high missing transverse momentum, and at least four jets. This signature was indicative of a hadronically decaying top-quark, a key component in identifying LQs​​​​.

To model the signal and background processes, Monte Carlo simulated event samples were used. These simulations incorporated various aspects of particle physics, like quantum chromodynamics and parton distribution functions, to accurately represent the expected results and compare them with the observed data​​.

This paper is a significant contribution to particle physics, as it advances the search for leptoquarks, which could potentially reshape our understanding of fundamental particles and forces. It's an exciting read for anyone interested in the frontiers of physics and the ongoing quest to understand the building blocks of our universe.
