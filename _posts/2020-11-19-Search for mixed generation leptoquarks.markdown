# [Search for pairs of scalar leptoquarks decaying into quarks and electrons or muons](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP10(2020)112)

This paper investigates the potential existence of leptoquarks (LQs). These are theoretical new particles that could bridge the gap between quarks and leptons, and are predicted by certain extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics​​. These particles are significant because they could explain several physical phenomena, such as the origins of neutrino masses and the matter/antimatter asymmetry in the universe. They could also unify electromagnetic and weak forces at high energies​​.

In the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), LQs could potentially be created through processes like gluon-gluon fusion and quark-antiquark annihilation. The paper focuses on examining the pair production of LQs, considering their possible decay into quarks and leptons across different generations, a scenario not extensively explored previously​​.

Utilizing the complete Run 2 dataset from the LHC, this study undertakes a detailed search for LQs, requiring the presence of an oppositely charged electron or muon in the event selection. This approach builds on previous searches for LQ pairs, extending the understanding of these theoretical particles and their potential role in the subatomic world​​.

The investigation contributes to the broader quest of understanding new physics and could potentially reshape our comprehension of fundamental particles and forces if LQs are found. This paper is a valuable read for those interested in particle physics and the ongoing efforts to unravel the mysteries of the universe.
