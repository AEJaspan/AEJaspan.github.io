# [Implementation of merged multi-leg $t\bar{t}$ samples at NLO accuracy using Matchbox framework in Herwig 7](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2692863)

This paper focuses on testing and validating the use of the Matchbox framework in [Herwig 7](https://herwig.hepforge.org/tutorials/index.html) for producing merged, multi-leg top-antitop ($t\bar{t}$) Monte Carlo samples at next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy. This study is a preliminary investigation into the viability of using Herwig 7 for future bulk Monte Carlo sample production for ATLAS analysis. Key aspects such as the speed of event generation, the fraction of negative weights, and the accuracy of these samples in modeling ATLAS data are discussed. However, no significant improvements over the nominal samples were observed, particularly in modeling high transverse momentum (pT) regions. This report contributes to the ongoing efforts to enhance the precision of particle physics simulations.â€‹
