# Building with LangChain

Last week, PwC UK hosted the GenAI Connect day. This event brought together over 1,400 technologists from across the firm, with a focused on learning around Generative AI. 

It was great to have the opportunity to deliver a session at this event, in which I gave a technical introduction to building generative AI applications using LangChain. It was a good opportunity to get into the pros and cons of LangChain, and to show technologists at PwC what is possible with this incredible new technology.
